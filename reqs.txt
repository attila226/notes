Build a Notes App
Here are the specs:

·  There should be a list of all notes.

·  You should be able to add a note.

·  You should be able to edit a note.

·  The notes should be persisted and retrieved via a service.

·  You should be able to go straight to a note if specified in the url (notesurl.com/note1).

Stretch Goals:
You do not need to implement these. If you want to and have the time. Just think about how you would go about implementing them and we'll walk through it in the in-person interview.

·  Input Validation

·  Unit testing

Parameters:
·  Frontend: We'd like you to use a frontend framework (React/Flux Backbone, Knockout, Ember, Angular or any other one you're familiar with. We'd just rather it not only be in jQuery).

·  Services: The server that hosts services can also host the html page so you don't run into cross origin problems. For frameworks (or lack thereof), use what you're familiar with but if you don't have a favorite, Express, Hapi, or the Node.js HTTP Server are all great options.

·  Persistence: A JSON file is fine, this doesn't need to be a distributed app. Lowdb is a great library for just this. If you know lodash/underscore, you know lowdb. If you'd rather something else, great. Just make sure the project is self-contained so we can run it

·  Source Control: We need to review and run your app, so please create a repo on GitHub Don't have a GitHub account? It's free to join.

Do's and Dont's
·  Do go with what you know. You don't need to use the latest and greatest.

·  Do add a readme with instructions to run.

·  Do read docs and use the vast resources of the internet. We don't expect you to know everything, but you should know where to find it.

·  Do let us know if you have any questions, problems or feedback. If you have any question, please reach out to me.

·  Don't worry about polish. Make it useable, but don't worry about styling.

·  Don't over engineer it. We don't need authentication, logging or minification.
